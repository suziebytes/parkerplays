# Parker Plays
Hello there! Be gentle on me! 
I started learning iOS December 2022 
Parker Plays was released by the end of Jan 2023 
It took me 2 months to design, learn, and bring this app to life! 

Parker Plays was my very first app. Prior to this, I never did any iOS coding. This app was developed after I started my first iOS tutorial (and never finished).  
As someone who learns better via hands on experience, I immeiately stopped the tutorial (which was focused on Storyboard) and began looking into UIKit and coding programmatically. 
The code is far from perfect and I may or may not come back to refactor it one day, but for now, it is what it is!  

These past two months have been a whirlwind! Here’s some things that I’ve learned and **applied**!
</br> ✅ UIKit
</br> ✅ Auto layout
</br> ✅ Familiarization, repetition, application of classes/struts
</br> ✅ UIImagePicker
</br> ✅ UICollectionView
</br> ✅ StoreKit2 - IAP
</br> ✅ Lottie animations as a dependency
</br> ✅ StackView
</br> ✅ Integration of Parental Gate
</br> ✅ MVC design architecture - started learning about this mid-way and tried to practice it, but failed miserably
</br> ✅ How to build, submit and release app into the AppStore

I’m excited for the next chapter and to learn more!
